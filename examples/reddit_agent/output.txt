<OUTPUT_EXAMPLE>
{
  "body_markdown": "If you haven't bombed a class yet, you're not learning. Recruiters trust resilience more than a 4.0 GPA. Tank algorithms, brag about the growth arc, and you'll ace the vibe checks. Stop flexing perfect transcripts and start flexing scar tissue.", // call out perfectionism, push failure-as-flex narrative, keep it cocky + motivational
  "flair": "Discussion",
  "title": "Hot take: every CS major should fail a class on purpose" // bold provocation that drags in every overachiever
}
