**Case:** shot_with_thought

## Input Params
```json

  "output": "Silver orb in velvet night,\nA silent watchman, pure and bright,\nGuiding sailors with its light."
}
```

## Output
```
User: Write a short poem about the moon.

<thought>The user wants a poem. I will think about themes like light, night, and loneliness. I will structure it in three short stanzas.</thought>

<output>
Silver orb in velvet night,
A silent watchman, pure and bright,
Guiding sailors with its light.
</output>
```

## Expectation
This shot includes a 'Thought' block. Review its placement and formatting to ensure it clearly represents a step before the final output.

## LLM Review
**Result:** pass
**Formatting rating:** 9

### Reasoning
```
The renderer output correctly includes the 'Thought' block, which is placed before the 'Output' block. This placement is logical as it represents the thought process before generating the final output. The formatting is clear, with the 'Thought' block enclosed in tags, making it distinct from the 'Output' block. The output also matches the user's request for a short poem about the moon, and the thought process aligns with the themes mentioned.
